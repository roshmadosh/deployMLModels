### Requirements
- Python 3


- To install the required dependencies, create and activate a Python environment for this project and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project's root directory.  


- For level 2 Windows users may want to install a Unix shell to run the BASH script, but Powershell or the like probably has analogous commands.  


- To complete level 3.5 you need to have an account registered with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
